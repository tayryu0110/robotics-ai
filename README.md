# AI for Robotics

## Codes can't be provide due to the university academic conduct 

### Asteroid Project
An agent that estimates asteroid locations and navigates across the field avoiding collisions.

### Ice Rover Project
The goal of this project is to give you practice implementing a SLAM module
and a robot control system that uses it to navigate through a world.

### Mars Glider Project
The goal of this project is to give you practice implementing a particle filter
used to localize a robotic glider that does not have access to terrestrial based
GPS satellites. The glider is released from a spacecraft over the surface of mars,
and receives a distance to ground measurement from a downward facing radar,
as well as an altitude estimate from a barometric pressure sensor.

### Warehouse Project
The goal of this project is to give you practice implementing the planning and control algorithms
introduced in the “Search” lesson and the path smoothing in the 2nd half of the “PID Control” lesson by
Professor Thrun. In each of the parts of the project, you will write a planner to guide a robot through a
warehouse to retrieve and deliver packages.
